I am a first year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. I have developing interests within algebra, number theory, and theoretical computer science. 

##### About me
❧ I grew up in Athens, Greece. My name is pronounced like the name of the Greek goddess of wisdom, just spelled differently.
❧ In 2023, I received a B.A. from Dartmouth College; I majored in Mathematics and got a minor in Computer Science. 
❧ Outside of math, my hobbies include aerial circus, reading books, and playing board games.
